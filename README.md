# Social-Media-Registeration
## Task
1) Create a RESTful API for a social media application. The API should have the following functionality:
2) User registration: Accept user information as input, such as name, email, and password, and add the user to the database.
3) User login: Accept email and password as input, and return a token that the user can use for subsequent requests.
4) Post a message: Accept a message and a token as input, and add the message to the database, associated with the user who posted it.
5) Get all messages: Return a list of all messages in the database, including the message text and the user who posted it.
6) Get messages by user ID: Accept a user ID as input and return a list of all messages posted by that user.

## Requirements:
1) Use Node.js and Express.js to create the API.
2) Store the users and messages in a MongoDB database.
3) Implement password hashing for user registration and login.
4) Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
5) The API should return JSON data.
6) Implement proper error handling, such as handling a request for a user that does not exist.

## Evaluation Criteria:
1) Correct functionality of all API endpoints.
2) Code quality and readability.
3) Proper error handling.
4) Adherence to RESTful API design principles.
5) Proper use of a MongoDB database for storing the users and messages.
6) Implementation of a secure connection to the MongoDB database.
7) Proper implementation of password hashing and JWT authentication.
